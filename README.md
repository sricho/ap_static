My Middleman Starter
====================



Ain't nothin' but a project starter template for the [Middleman static site generator](http://middlemanapp.com/) forked from [Tom Bryan, middleman_starter](https://github.com/tombryan/middleman_starter) that steals heavily from [Nathan Henderson's Amicus](https://github.com/nathos/amicus) and [Ben Smithett's Style](https://github.com/bensmithett/style).

It's for people who prefer ERB to Haml, and who like [BEM](http://bem.info/), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/). This fork includes [Typecsset](https://github.com/csswizardry/typecsset), some handy wrappers for Typecsset and some other goodies, I'll update this list when it gets growing. It even has a style guide if you're into [atomic design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

### How do I even?
- You'll want to `$ gem install middleman` if you haven't already (and read the [documentation](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/) to find out how it works).
- `$ git clone http://github.com/sricho/middleman_starter.git my_sweet_project`
- `$ bundle install`
- `$ cd my_sweet_project && bundle exec middleman server`
- Make something nice.

Alternatively, you can (re)use this template like a pro by cloning it into `~/middleman` and using the template argument when you initialize a new project:

- `$ git clone http://github.com/sricho/middleman_starter.git ~/.middleman/middleman_starter`
- `$ middleman init my_sweet_project --template=middleman_starter`

### Is there a build preview anywhere?

### lolwut?
**Stop.** This is a WIP and **also** it is put together for the way *I* like to do things. If *you* like to do things a different way you should just do that and *stop yelling at me*.

Pull requests are (mostly) welcome.
