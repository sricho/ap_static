  <h2>The Autopilot story</h2>

  <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I run a number of online stores and know how time-consuming
  it is to pick, pack and ship all of your orders out.</p>

  <p>I found that existing order fulfilment companies were not suitable for my
  small eCommerce stores. They were difficult to set up, confusing, inflexible,
  and expensive.</p>

  <p>Disappointed, I resumed shipping my own orders and soon realised that
  there must be other online stores in the same position as I was. By storing
  and shipping their stock, I could offer the service that I was looking for.
  And so AutoPilot was born.</p>

  <p>Since we're a small business, we offer the flexibility, personal service,
  and care that you can't get from a large 3rd party logistics (3PL) company.
  We know how important it is for orders to be picked, packed and shipped
  quickly and correctly because that's what we value in our own online
  stores.</p>

  <p>We specialise in small items, and ship via Australia Post's eParcel system
  where possible.</p>

  <p>If you want a reliable, straightforward 3PL solution, feel free to get in
  touch!</p>

  <p>Located in Cheltenham, Melbourne.</p>
